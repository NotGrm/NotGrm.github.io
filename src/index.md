# It's-a-me, Jeremy!

Hi! I'm a software engineer with a passion for [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org). Despite my large experience in the backend field, I also have a strong interest in frontend development (my heart goes to [EmberJS](https://emberjs.com)), and devops activities.

I'm a father of 2 sons and a husband. I love to spend time with my family, and they are my main motivation to work hard, improve my skills, and be a better person.

On my free times, I read books, play video games, run outside, I recently have started scuba diving.
