Hi! I'm a software engineer with a passion for [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org). Despite my large experience in the backend field, I also have a strong interest in frontend development (my heart goes to [EmberJS](https://emberjs.com), but I have worked with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [React](https://fr.react.dev/) in the past), and devops activities ([Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Ansible](https://www.redhat.com/en/ansible-collaborative)).

I'm a father of 2 sons and a husband. I love to spend time with my family, and they are my main motivation to work hard, improve my skills, and be a better person.

On my free times, I read books, play video games, run outside, I recently have started scuba diving.
